        <dt>1:What is the difference between local storage and session storage?</dt>
         <dd>sessionStorage is similar to localStorage. The difference is that while data in localStorage doesn't expire, data in sessionStorage is cleared when the page session ends.</dd>
        <dt>2:Differences Between Local Scope and Global Scope</dt>
        <dd> Global scope contains all of the things defined outside of all code blocks.A global variable has global scope. A global variable is accessible from anywhere in the code. and  Local scope contains things defined inside code blocks.A local variable has local scope. A local variable is only accessible where itâ€™s declared.</dd>
        <dt>3:How the event loop works</dt>
        <dd>The event loop works by making a request to some internal or external "event provider" (that generally blocks the request until an event has arrived), then calls the relevant event handle</dd>
